*lszip* - command-line program which can list content of some specific directory in archive.

This program emerged because I could not find simple way to get listing of some specific directory in zip archive.

Solutions which I tried are:

1. Mounting ZIP archives through FUSE filesystem. 

   Drawback: Linux specific and does not work in Windows)

2. Use unzip.

   Drawback: unfortunately for some archives you may get directories as separate items ex. emacs-23.2/bin/ and for some not. It means that you should handle this situations somehow, otherwise you will not get a full listing of the directory since subdirectories will not be shown. I tried to handle this writing a script but for very big archives it was too slow.

lszip proved to work fast enough with ~100 mb jar files. Why jar files? Because they guaranteed to have a lot of files inside.

Requirements: zlib

Usage:
